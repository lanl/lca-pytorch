# Contributing to LCA-PyTorch

## Adding new Features
Adding new features, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful 
contributions. Furthermore, if you are publishing new work using LCA-PyTorch, we strongly encourage you to add it to the 
LCA-PyTorch repository so that others may evaluate it fairly in their own work.

Bug fixes can be initiated through GitHub pull requests. When making code contributions to LCA-PyTorch, we ask that you use the black code format and that you provide unit tests for the new features.

Contributions of new features must include unit test covering as many new statements as possible.

## Unit tests
When submitting additional unit tests for LCA-PyTorch, in order to keep the code base maintainable, please try to avoid unit tests with long runtimes if possible.
